# ManiaScript
ManiaScript is a scripting language made by Ubisoft Nadeo for their games such as [Trackmania](https://www.trackmania.com). It can be used to create and control a lot of things throughout these games, reaching from simple visual elements to editor plugins and even custom game modes.

## Prerequisites
Writing ManiaScript requires basic knowledge of how object-oriented programming languages work. You will need to declare variables, check conditions, loop over lists, call functions or access properties of classes. This documentation will not cover these bosics. If you aren't familiar with an object-oriented language yet (such as Java, JavaScript, C#, Python or PHP), a training resource for one of these languages will be a better starting point for your journey.

## ManiaScript vs ManiaLink
When dealing with ManiaScript, you will most likely encounter the term ManiaLink at some point - Therefore it is important to understand what the difference between them is and how they complement each other. While ManiaScript itself is a mostly generic programming language and is therefore used in a lot different places, ManiaLinks are used when you want to display something to the user.

For someone familiar with website development, a very good comparison would be HTML and JavaScript - While HTML is a markup language, representing elements such as text, buttons or images, JavaScript can be used to make said HTML page more dynamic, by adding custom logic or modifying the website elements at runtime. In the same way, ManiaLinks can display visual elements defined via XML and ManiaScript can be used to add custom logic to make them more dynamic.

However, interacting with ManiaLinks is only one of the many uses of ManiaScript - There are a lot of places where custom logic can be written to modify a part of the game without the need for a ManiaLink to display something.
