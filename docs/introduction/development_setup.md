# Development Setup
ManiaScript files are text files with a `.Script.txt` extension. Therefore, they can be edited in any text editor of your choice.

Trackmania also offers an ingame editor and debugger. You can use them by pressing:
- Scroll: Open ManiaScript editor
- Ctrl + G (When outside the editor): Open a window that can be toggled between log, debug and off state
- Shift + Scroll (In some cases): Force reload ManiaLinks and ManiaScripts

The ingame editor offers a few basic functionalities such as opening multiple files, syntax highlighting, search & replace, saving, live compile and reload and a debugger. It is the easiest way to develop and test a feature on the fly.

You can also use an external IDE such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ to edit your files, especially for large projects that are split into a lot of scripts. Visual Studio Code even has an extension called [maniascript-support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=reaby.maniascript-support), that offers syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
