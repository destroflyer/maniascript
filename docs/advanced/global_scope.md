# Global scope

## Global variables
Variables declared in the global scope are called global variables, as they are accessible throughout the entire program.

Global variables can not be declared with an initial value. Thus, an explicit type is mandatory.

## Order
The different global scope parts of your script have to be defined in a specific order:

1. [Directives](/advanced/directives.html)
2. [Global variables](#global-variables)
3. [Label](/advanced/labels.html) implementations
4. [Functions](/basics/functions.html)
