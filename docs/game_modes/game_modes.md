# Game modes
Game modes are created via a ManiaScript file that [extends](/advanced/directives.html#extends) a Nadeo base game mode.

You can test game modes in your `Scripts` directory in the [ingame editor](/introduction/development_setup.html#editor).

Once a server starts, it will execute a [server loop](/game_modes/server_loop.html) that your script can hook into.
